          Han Solo is introduced in Star Wars, when he and his co-pilot Chewbacca accept a charter
          request to transport Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from Tatooine to
          Alderaan on their ship, the Millennium Falcon. Han owes crime lord Jabba the Hutt a great
          deal of money and has a price on his head; when the bounty hunter Greedo tries to deliver
          him to Jabba, Han shoots him and prepares to leave Tatooine. Han and his passengers are
          attacked by Imperial stormtroopers, but escape by accelerating to light speed. When they
          arrive at Alderaan, however, they discover that the planet has been destroyed. The Falcon
          is then captured and held within the Death Star, a moon-sized battle station constructed
          by the Empire. Han and company hide from detection inside the Falcon's smuggling bays,
          and infiltrate the station disguised as stormtroopers. They discover that Princess Leia
          Organa is a prisoner on board, and Luke convinces Han to help rescue her by promising him
          a huge reward. They rescue Leia and escape, though Obi-Wan is killed by Sith Lord Darth Vader. <br/>

          After delivering Luke, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to the Rebel Alliance, Han and Chewbacca
          receive a payment for their services and prepare to leave. Luke asks Han to stay and help
          the Rebels attack the Death Star, but he refuses, not wanting to get involved. Han has a
          change of heart and returns to save Luke's life during the film's climactic battle scene,
          ultimately enabling Luke to destroy the Death Star. For his heroics, Han is presented with
          a medal of honor.

          Han returns with the Rebel Alliance to Echo Base on the frozen planet of Hoth. While out
          on patrol with Luke, they witness a meteor strike the surface. Han returns to base while
          Luke decides to investigate. Han informs Leia and the General of Echo Base that he must
          leave in order to clear his debt with Jabba. Before he can depart, it is discovered that
          Luke has not returned from his reconnaissance. Han rides out alone into the frozen Hoth
          wastelands, soon finding Luke badly injured and near death from exposure. Using his
          friend's lightsaber, Han cuts open his tauntaun, providing Luke warmth while he builds a
          shelter until they can be rescued the next morning. <br/>

          Later, Han and Chewbacca are sent out to investigate another meteor strike. They discover
          that the 'meteor' is actually an Imperial Probe Droid. The two succeed in destroying the
          probe, but not before the Empire is alerted to the location of Echo Base. <br/>

          When the Empire attacks Echo Base, Han, Chewie, Leia, and C-3PO narrowly escape on board
          the Millennium Falcon. Han evades a squad of Imperial TIE fighters by flying through an
          asteroid field, and unwittingly flies into the mouth of a giant worm. Han and Leia fall in
          love during the long journey. They manage to hide from the Imperial fleet long enough to
          escape, but not entirely unnoticed. Bounty hunter Boba Fett secretly follows the Falcon
          during this getaway. <br/>

          Han and company eventually end up at the Bespin system's Cloud City seeking repairs and
          shelter from his old friend Lando Calrissian, the city's administrator. However, Fett
          had arrived first and alerted the Empire. Under threat of death, Lando betrays Han to
          the Empire. Vader wishes to capture Luke by freezing him in carbonite, and subjects Solo
          to the freezing process first to test its lethality. Solo survives, his captors are
          satisfied, and Fett leaves for Tatooine with a frozen Han in tow to collect the bounty
          from Jabba.

          Han, still imprisoned in carbonite, is now Jabba's favorite decoration at his palace on
          Tatooine. Luke attempts a rescue operation aided by Leia, Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and
          R2D2, but they are caught. Jabba sentences Han and Luke to die in the Sarlaac Pit. Luke,
          Leia, and Han overpower their captors and escape, killing Jabba in the process. <br/>

          Retreating back to the Rebel Base, they discover that the Empire is building another Death
          Star around the forest moon of Endor. Following his return, Han is made a general in the
          Rebel Alliance along with Leia. Reuniting with Luke after his return from Dagobah, Han
          leads the Rebels down to Endor to take down the force field surrounding the battle
          station, which is still under construction. With help from the native Ewoks, Han and his
          team destroy the Death Star's shield generator, allowing Lando and his strike force to
          destroy the Death Star. Han then reunites with Leia and Luke on Endor to celebrate the
          defeat of the Empire.
