          Rowling first introduces Ron with his family in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
          Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station and the Weasleys guide him through the
          barrier of Platform 9¾ into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the
          Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship: Ron fascinated with the famous Harry,
          and Harry fascinated with the ordinary Ron. It is here that they both meet Hermione
          Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend
          after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll. Ron and
          Harry share the same classes throughout the series, and generally have similar academic
          successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the
          Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed
          safely through a dangerous life-size, animated chess game. During the game, Ron allows his
          piece to be sacrificed and is subsequently knocked unconscious. At the Leaving Feast, the
          last dinner of the school year, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' Headmaster, awards Ron fifty
          House points to Gryffindor for "the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many
          years." These last-minute points help support Gryffindor's win of the House Cup.

          The second installment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, takes place the year
          following the events of the Philosopher's Stone. During the summer, Ron attempts to write
          to Harry several times. He receives no reply because Dobby the house elf is stopping
          Harry's wizard mail. Ron becomes so concerned that he and his brothers Fred and George
          fly their father's enchanted Ford Anglia car to Harry's home at his aunt and uncle's
          house. Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to
          depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the
          barrier to access Platform 9¾. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying
          Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power at the end of
          the journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but
          Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden
          Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is
          prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car.

          In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron's role is minor compared to that in
          Chamber of Secrets, and Hermione's role, which was more sidelined in Chamber of Secrets,
          is larger. When Ron's rat, Scabbers, already seen in Philosopher's Stone, goes missing, he
          blames Hermione's new cat Crookshanks, and the two have a falling out. They eventually
          make up when Hermione has a nervous breakdown brought by taking too many classes and
          distress at the fate of the hippogriff Buckbeak. The animal, owned by Hagrid, has been
          put on trial for injuring Draco and risks execution. Ron offers to help with the
          preparation of Buckbeak's defence, but this fails to help. Harry, Ron and Hermione go to
          see Hagrid on the execution day where they discover Scabbers hiding out in Hagrid's hut.
          As they leave, Scabbers struggles free of Ron and runs away. He chases Scabbers to the
          Whomping Willow where he is grabbed by a large black dog and dragged into a tunnel
          hidden below the tree.
