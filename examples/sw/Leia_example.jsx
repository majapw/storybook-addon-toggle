          Introduced in Star Wars, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan is a
          member of the Imperial Senate. She is captured by Darth Vader on board the ship Tantive
          IV, where she is acting as a spy for the Rebel Alliance. Leia has secretly hidden the
          plans for the Death Star, the Empire's planet-sized battle station, inside the astromech
          droid R2-D2 and has sent it to find one of the last remaining Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the
          nearby planet of Tatooine. Vader arrests Leia and has her tortured, but she resists
          revealing anything. Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin threatens to destroy her home
          planet Alderaan with the Death Star unless she reveals the location of the hidden Rebel
          base. She provides the location of an old, abandoned base, but Tarkin orders Alderaan to
          be destroyed anyway. Leia is rescued by Obi-Wan, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, the Wookiee
          Chewbacca and the two droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, and they escape aboard Han's ship, the
          Millennium Falcon. After analyzing the Death Star's plans, the Rebels find a tiny weakness
          in the battle station, which Luke uses to destroy it in his X-wing fighter. The battle
          won, Leia bestows medals on its heroes at the hidden Rebel base on Yavin 4.

          In The Empire Strikes Back, Leia is at the Rebel base on Hoth. She leads its
          evacuation during an Imperial attack, and then flees with Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO on
          Han's ship, the Millennium Falcon. They dodge pursuing Imperial TIE fighters by flying
          into an asteroid field when the Falcon's hyperdrive breaks down, with Leia piloting the
          ship at one point. Romance blossoms between Leia and Han during their flight from the
          Empire; while hiding in the stomach of a space slug, they finally share a kiss. With his
          ship needing repairs, Han seeks out his old friend Lando Calrissian in Cloud City, the
          floating city over Bespin. Though he welcomes them graciously, Lando soon turns them over
          to a newly arrived Darth Vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture Luke. Leia
          confesses her love for Han as he is frozen in carbonite and then handed over to bounty h
          unter Boba Fett, who is charged with bringing him to gangster Jabba the Hutt. Lando helps
          Leia, Chewbacca and the two droids escape. Leia senses that Luke is in trouble, and goes
          back to save him after he is nearly killed during a lightsaber duel with Vader.

          In Return of the Jedi, Leia infiltrates Jabba's palace on Tatooine disguised as the
          Ubese bounty hunter Boushh, and brings a captive Chewbacca with her as part of the ruse.
          She frees Han from the carbonite, but they are recaptured by Jabba. Leia is now chained
          to Jabba as his slave, outfitted in a metal bikini. After Luke arrives and kills Jabba's
          Rancor, Jabba sentences Luke, Han and Chewbacca to be fed to the Sarlacc. Lando
          (disguised as a guard) helps them overpower their captors, and Leia seizes the moment to
          strangle Jabba with her chain. Luke and Leia swing to safety, blowing up Jabba's barge
          behind them. Later, the heroes go to the forest moon of Endor to prepare for a battle with
          the Empire. There, Luke reveals to Leia that she is his twin sister and that Vader is
          their father. Leia joins Han in leading the Rebels in battle with Imperial troops as the
          Rebel Fleet attacks the second Death Star. Leia is slightly injured, but the Rebels, with
          help from the Ewoks, defeat the forces of the Empire.
