          Luke Skywalker lives on a moisture farm on Tatooine with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru.
          Luke takes his first steps toward his destiny when he buys the droids C-3PO and R2-D2.
          When R2-D2 goes missing, Luke goes out to find him and encounters Obi-Wan Kenobi, an old
          hermit. Luke discovers that R2-D2 contains a message for Obi-Wan from Princess Leia Organa
          of Alderaan beseeching him to help her defeat the Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan says that he
          and Luke's father were once Jedi Knights, and that his father was murdered by a traitorous
          Jedi named Darth Vader. Obi-Wan presents Luke with his father's lightsaber and offers to
          take him to Alderaan and train him in the ways of the Force, but Luke rejects his offer. <br/>

          Luke changes his mind when he returns home to find that Imperial stormtroopers have killed
          his aunt and uncle. He and Obi-Wan then obtain passage with smugglers Han Solo and
          Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, to Alderaan only to find that it has been destroyed
          by the Death Star, the ship is lured to the Death Star via a tractor beam and whilst
          evading the Imperial troops they rescue Princess Leia. Obi-Wan deactivates the tractor
          beam and he later sacrifices his life in a duel with Vader so that Luke and his friends
          can board the Falcon and escape. <br/>

          During the film's climactic battle scene, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance in attacking the
          Death Star. In the trench leading to the Death Star's exhaust port, Luke hears Obi-Wan's
          voice telling him to "trust his feelings"; he takes Obi-Wan's advice and switches off his
          X-wing's missile guidance system, instead using the Force to guide the missiles and
          destroy the Death Star.

          In The Empire Strikes Back, set three years after the first film, Luke is now a lieutenant
          commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is nearly
          killed by a Wampa, but manages to escape. In the frozen wasteland, he sees Obi-Wan's
          spirit telling him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training with the
          Jedi Master Yoda, before he is rescued by Han. When the Empire discovers the Rebel base
          on Hoth, Luke leads his squadron to cover the evacuation. Escaping Hoth in his X-wing,
          he travels to Dagobah and meets Yoda. He undergoes rigorous Jedi training, quickly
          increasing his power in the Force. <br/>

          During his training, Luke sees a vision of his friends in danger. Against both Obi-Wan
          and Yoda's advice, he travels to Cloud City to save them, only to be lured into a
          lightsaber duel with Darth Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for
          Vader; the Sith Lord overpowers Luke and severs his right hand. Vader then reveals that he
          is Luke's father and offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force, and rule
          the galaxy at his side. Horrified, Luke throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. He
          survives, but is sucked into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City and left
          hanging onto a weather vane. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon,
          senses Luke's peril and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the ship, he hears Vader
          telepathically telling him that it is his destiny to join the dark side. Luke's
          missing hand is replaced with a bio-mechanical one.

          One year later in Return of the Jedi, Luke is now a Jedi Knight and has constructed his
          own lightsaber. He helps Leia, the droids and Lando Calrissian save Han from gangster
          Jabba the Hutt. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, but instead is forced to fight
          Jabba's fearsome Rancor. When Luke kills the monster, he is sentenced to death in the
          Sarlacc Pit. Luke escapes with R2-D2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's
          barge. <br/>

          During his return trip to Dagobah, Luke learns from a dying Yoda that Vader is his father.
          Luke then learns from Obi-Wan's spirit that he has a twin sister, whom he immediately
          realises is Leia. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must face Vader again in order to save the
          galaxy. <br/>

          Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an
          attempt to bring his father back from the dark side of the Force. Vader brings Luke to the
          second Death Star orbiting around Endor. Emperor Palpatine tries to goad him into giving
          into his anger and striking him down. Luke momentarily lashes out with his lightsaber,
          but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son battle each other again in a final duel.
          Luke keeps his emotions under control until Vader senses that Luke has a sister, and
          threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Enraged, Luke viciously
          attacks Vader, defeating him whilst severing his father's mechanical right hand. The
          Emperor orders Luke to kill Vader and take his place. Luke glances at his own bionic hand
          and realises he is on the verge of suffering his father's fate. He throws his lightsaber
          aside, declaring his allegiance to the Jedi. <br/>

          Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. In agony, Luke calls out to his
          father for help; unwilling to let his son die, Vader grabs his former master and throws
          him down a reactor shaft to his death, Vader is mortally wounded by the Emperor's
          lightning in the process. As Rebel fighters race toward the Death Star's main reactor,
          Luke removes Vader's mask and looks upon his father's face for the first time. The
          redeemed Anakin Skywalker assures Luke that there was good in him after all, and dies.
          On Endor, Luke burns his father's body on a funeral pyre. During the Rebel's victory
          celebrations on Endor, Luke sees his father's spirit alongside those of Obi-Wan and Yoda. <br/>
