          Hermione first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone when she meets Harry
          and Ron on the Hogwarts Express. She constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge, so
          Harry and Ron initially consider her arrogant; especially after she criticises Ron's
          incantation of the Levitation Charm. They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from
          a troll, for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus
          winning their friendship. Hermione's knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a
          puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and she defeats the
          constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of "bluebell flame".

          Hermione (along with Ron's mother Molly Weasley and a few female students of Hogwarts)
          develops a liking for Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart as he had
          written all the books required for the subject of Defence Against The Dark Arts in Harry
          Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. During a morning confrontation between the Gryffindor
          and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly ensues after Draco Malfoy calls her a
          "Mudblood", an insulting epithet for Muggle-born wizards when she defends the Gryffindor
          Quidditch team. She concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise
          themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin who
          has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. However, she is unable to join Harry and Ron in the
          investigation after the hair plucked from the robes of Slytherin student Millicent
          Bulstrode (with whom Hermione was previously matched up during Lockhart's ill-fated
          Duelling Club) was that of her cat, whose appearance she takes on in her human form; it
          takes several weeks for the effects to completely wear off. Hermione is Petrified by the
          basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research. Though she
          lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, her information is crucial to Harry and Ron in
          their successful mission to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is
          revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but she is distraught to learn that all
          end-of-year exams have been cancelled as a school treat.

          Hermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who takes to chasing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.
          Before the start of term, Professor McGonagall secretly gives her a Time-Turner, a device
          which enables her to go back in time and handle her heavy class schedule, though this is
          not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione
          and her two best friends; Harry is furious with her because she told McGonagall that he
          had received a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic.
          Ron is angry because he feels Crookshanks is responsible for Scabbers' disappearance,
          while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.

          While filling in for Remus Lupin in one Defence Against the Dark Arts class, Snape labels
          Hermione "an insufferable know-it-all" and penalises Gryffindor after she speaks out of
          turn in her attempt to describe a werewolf when no one else does. She correctly deduces
          Lupin's secret after completing Snape's homework assignment from the class, while
          Crookshanks proves vital in exposing Scabbers as Peter Pettigrew, a friend of James and
          Lily Potter who revealed their whereabouts to Lord Voldemort the night of their murders,
          and was able to wrongly implicate Sirius Black (revealed to be Harry's godfather) in the
          Potters' deaths. The Time-Turner enables Hermione and Harry to rescue Sirius and the
          hippogriff Buckbeak.
