          Harry first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Starting in 1981, when
          Harry was just one year old, his parents, James and Lily, were murdered by the most
          powerful Dark Wizard, Lord Voldemort (frequently called "You-Know-Who" and
          "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" by those too superstitious to use his actual name).
          He attempted to kill Harry too, but was unsuccessful and only left a lightning bolt shaped
          scar on Harry's forehead. Voldemort's body was destroyed, but his soul was not. Harry
          later learns that the reason why he survived was because of Lily sacrificing herself for
          him and that love was something that Voldemort could not destroy.

          In the second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Rowling pits Harry against
          Tom Riddle, Lord Voldemort's "memory" within a secret diary which has possessed Ron's
          younger sister Ginny Weasley. When Muggle-born students are suddenly being Petrified,
          many suspect that Harry may be behind the attacks, further alienating him from his peers.
          Furthermore, Harry begins to doubt his worthiness for House of Gryffindor, particularly
          considering he discovers he shares Lord Voldemort's ability to communicate with snakes
          via Parseltongue. In the climax, Ginny disappears. To rescue her, Harry battles Riddle
          and the monster he controls that is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets. To defeat the
          monster, Harry summons the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat supplied by
          Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes. In doing so, Dumbledore later restores Harry's
          self-esteem by explaining that feat is clear proof of his worthiness of his present house.

          In the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Rowling uses a time travel
          premise. Harry learns that his parents were betrayed to Voldemort by their friend Peter
          Pettigrew, who framed Harry's godfather Sirius Black for the crimes, condemning him to
          Azkaban, the wizard prison. When Sirius escapes to find Harry, Harry and Hermione use a
          Time Turner to save him and a hippogriff named Buckbeak. When Pettigrew escapes, an
          innocent Sirius becomes a hunted fugitive once again. Harry learns how to create a
          Patronus which takes the form of a stag, the same as his late father's.
